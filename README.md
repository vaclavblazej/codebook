## History and Contributions

This project was initiated at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague by V. Blažej with early support from J. Malík, J. M. Křišťan, J. Pokorný, Morass, and other teachers of the Competitive Programming course (BI-ACM).
Since March 2025 the project was stripped of other supporting tools and history was wiped and only the problems, the solutions, and the book are gradually revised and added in; also from that point on, it is kept in this github repository.
