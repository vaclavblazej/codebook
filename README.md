## History and Contributions

This project was initiated at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague by V. Blažej with early support from J. Malík, J. M. Křišťan, J. Pokorný, Morass, and other teachers of the Competitive Programming course (BI-ACM).
In March 2025 the project was stripped of the internal support tools and private git history.
From then on coded solutions to defined problem statements live in this public repository.
They are being gradually reworked along with their presentation on a deployed website and a printable pdf.
