For online contests one can use any tool to write the code.
Note that the choice ultimately doesn't matter, you'd be suprised what top competitive coders use.

If you have no idea you can try:

* [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - good extensible text editor used by many programmers
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - arcane powerful editor with steep learning curve

With on-site contests it is important to know what program you will use for coding.
There will be some basic setup that you do for the program -- this should be prepared in advance.
